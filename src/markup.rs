//! Functionality for displaying different Curium types to humans. The ITA book and crystallography
//! literature uses a concise format that doesn't easily translate to ASCII. It can be mocked in
//! Unicode, but that is brittle for some user environments. When preparing for publication, output
//! in LaTeX or Typst is instead required. Because of this, there's not just one way to turn Curium
//! types into a human-readable string. The solution is a unified markup format that allows Curium
//! types to format themselves in a single way and, from that, generate alternative presentations.
//! The resulting markup is also just useful for a variety of UI applications, even outside of the
//! specific needs of the library itself.

/// A primitive in Curium's markup system. Any type that can represent itself using these pieces
/// can easily be faithfully rendered in different formats.
